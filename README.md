# OSOC Typescript Workshop

Welcome to the OSOC Typescript workshop. While the presentation is going on, you can follow the instructions given by Bo Robbrecht and try it out yourself!

## Getting started
1. Make sure you have the following dependencies & Tools installed:
- [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2. Use this template repository to make your own repository based on this version. You can click the [**Use this template**](https://github.com/BT-Creator/osoc-2022-ts-presentation/generate) button to make your own.

3. Clone your version to your desktop using `git clone`
4. Open a terminal window in the cloned directory and download the TypeScript dependency `globally`:
```bash
npm install -g typescript
```
5. Go ham üçñ and enjoy tooling around with TypeScript

## Demonstrated code
You can look at the demonstrated code yourself by going to the [`ts-conversion` branch](https://github.com/BT-Creator/osoc-2022-ts-presentation/tree/ts-conversion)

## Going further?
Enjoying TypeScript? This presentation is only a small part of what TypeScript has to offer. If you really want to go in-depth, I suggest the following resources:

- [**Typescript Handbook**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html): The TypeScript handbook is the official introduction written by the TypeScript devs. This goes over the core of TypeScript and is a nice way to get started with TypeScript!
- [**Awesome TypeScript**](https://github.com/dzharii/awesome-typescript): Awesome TypeScript is an collection of many resources, frameworks, tools, etc... That make use of TypeScript
